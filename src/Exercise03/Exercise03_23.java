 * Exercise 3.23 (Geometry: point in a rectangle?) Write a program that prompts the user to enter a
 * point(x, y)and checks whether the point is within the rectangle centered at (0,0) with width 10
 * and height 5. For example, (2,2) is inside the rectangle and (6,4) is outside the rectangle, as shown in Figure 3.9b. 
 * (Hint: A point is in the rectangle if its horizontal distance to (0,0) is less than or equal to 10 / 2
 * and its vertical distance to (0,0) is less than or equal to 5.0 / 2. Test your program to cover
 * all cases.)
