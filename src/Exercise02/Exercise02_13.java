/*
(Financial application: compound value) Suppose you save $100 each month into a savings account 
with the annual interest rate 5%. Thus, the monthly inter- est rate is 0.05/12 = 0.00417. 
After the first month, the value in the account becomes
         100 * (1 + 0.00417) = 100.417
After the second month, the value in the account becomes
         (100 + 100.417) * (1 + 0.00417) = 201.252
After the third month, the value in the account becomes
         (100 + 201.252) * (1 + 0.00417) = 302.507
and so on.
Write a program that prompts the user to enter a monthly saving amount and displays the 
account value after the sixth month. (In Exercise 4.30, you will use a loop to simplify 
the code and display the account value for any month.)
