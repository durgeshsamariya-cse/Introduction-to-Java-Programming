----------------------------------------------Exercise 02_20-------------------------------------------
(Financial application: calculate interest) If you know the balance and the annual
percentage interest rate, you can compute the interest on the next monthly payment using the following formula:
interest = balance * (annualInterestRate / 1200)
Write a program that reads the balance and the annual percentage interest rate and
displays the interest for the next month. Here is a sample run:
*/
public class Exercise02_20 {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		double balance, annualIntrestRate, interest;// defining variables balance annualIntrestRate,Interest as double
		Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);// creatinf instance of Scanner class for taking input
		System.out.print("Enter balance and interest rate:  ");// telling user to enter the balance and
																// annualIntrestRate
		balance = input.nextDouble();// Storing the input of balance
		annualIntrestRate = input.nextDouble();// Storing the input of annualIntrestRate
		interest = balance * (annualIntrestRate / 1200);// calculating the interest
		System.out.println("The interest is " + interest);// Dispalying the finbal total Interest

	}
