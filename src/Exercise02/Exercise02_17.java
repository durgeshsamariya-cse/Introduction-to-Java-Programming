 * (Science: wind-chill temperature) How cold is it outside? The temperature alone is
 * not enough to provide the answer. Other factors including wind speed, relative
 * humidity, and sunshine play important roles in determining coldness outside. In
 * 2001, the National Weather Service (NWS) implemented the new wind-chill temperature
 * to measure the coldness using temperature and wind speed. The formula is:
 * where is the outside temperature measured in degrees Fahrenheit and v is the speed
 * measured in miles per hour. is the wind-chill temperature. The formula cannot be
 * used for wind speeds below 2 mph or temperatures below or above
 * Write a program that prompts the user to enter a temperature between and
 * and a wind speed greater than or equal to 2 and displays the wind-chill temperature.
 * Use Math.pow(a, b) to compute v0.16. Here is a sample run:
 * twc = 35.74 + 0.6215ta - 35.75v0.16 + 0.4275tav0.16
